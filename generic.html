									<h1>Hello!!<br /></h1>
									<p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Vasundhara L Kadekodi and I am a recent graduate of Karnatak University, Dharwad, where I earned my Master's degree in Statistics with a GPA of 76.4%. I am currently pursuing a Data Science course from IIITB, and after completing my Master's, I began my career as a Statistics Lecturer. I have been working in this role for 1.6 years and have gained valuable experience in the field of statistics.</p>

								<div\ class="image main"><img src="images/Vasu.jpg" alt="" />
								<p>However, I am now eager to transition my career to the data science field, and I am confident that my background in statistics, combined with my recent studies in data science, will make me a valuable asset to any organization. I have a good understanding of tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, and I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills in this field.</p>
								<p>In addition to my professional interests, I am also a Yakshagana artist and have a passion for drawing. I believe that my diverse interests have helped me develop a unique perspective and approach to problem-solving. I am able to think creatively and outside the box, which is an important skill in the field of data science.</p>
								<p>On this website, you will find some of my projects, which will give you a sense of my skills and abilities in the data science field. I am excited to have the opportunity to showcase my work and I look forward to the opportunity to work with you. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my background and experience, please feel free to reach out to me via my LinkedIn profile or other social media links. I would be more than happy to connect with you.</p>
